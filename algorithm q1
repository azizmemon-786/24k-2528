Q1. Implement an algorithm for determining if an Nth is a divisor of an n Number (i.e. 2 is a divisor of 6).
If so, determine if itâ€™s an even number or odd number as well.

input the number n
input the deviser Nth
if n/Nth==0
then Nth is deviser of n
if Nth % 2 == 0
then Nth is even number
else Nth is odd number
end
